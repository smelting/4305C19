%down_sample
% This function takes in a packet with excess bits from demodulation. and % downsamples based on the small number of consequtive bits
%% Starts a litte in because sometimes the first bits are compromised

%% finding the start of the next change so it does not throw off count 
while packet(ind) == val && ind < lenPacket
    ind = ind + 1; 
end

%% Calculates the min number of consequtive bits and is the default single bit
